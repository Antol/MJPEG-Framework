# MJPEG Framework

A MJPEG Framework for iOS

## MJPEG Connection

MJPEGConnection is a NSURLConnection subclass that takes an url, username and password. 

It has a responseDidFinisch callback that pass through each received image data

## MJPEG ImageView

## Swift

I love Appleâ€™s new language Swift. For this reason I have written my MJPEG Framework in Swift.

## IP-Camera Viewer

I use this Framework for my app [IP-Camera Viewer](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/ip-camera-viewer/id806365210)
